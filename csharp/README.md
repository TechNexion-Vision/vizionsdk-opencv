This is a simple project for demonstrating how to use CSVizionSDK with OpenCV.

---

## Running the C# project

Before building the sample, open the project's .csproj file and make sure it includes the correct references and configurations.

### Verify .csproj Settings

Open the .csproj file and confirm it has the proper setup.
Hereâ€™s an example configuration:
```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
<PropertyGroup>
    <!-- Target framework version -->
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
</PropertyGroup>

<ItemGroup>
    <!-- Reference the CSVizionSDK NuGet package -->
    <PackageReference Include="CSVizionSDK" Version="VERSION" />
    <!-- Reference the OpenCvSharp NuGet package -->
    <PackageReference Include="OpenCvSharp4.runtime.win" Version="VERSION" />
	<PackageReference Include="OpenCvSharp4.Windows" Version="VERSION" />
</ItemGroup>
</Project>
```
Replace `VERSION` with the correct version of the CSVizionSDK/OpenCvSharp package.

Ensure that the target framework matches the one supported by the package, such as:
- net8.0 (recommended)
- net6.0
- or netstandard2.0 for library projects.

### Build and Run the Sample
Follow the steps below to build and run the sample:

1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell).

2. Navigate to the sample project directory:
    ```shell
    cd vizionsdk-opencv/csharp
    ```

3. Build the project:
    ```shell
    dotnet build {PROJECT_NAME}

    # for example
    dotnet build captureImg
    ```

4. Run the sample:
    ```shell
    dotnet run --project {PROJECT_NAME}

    # for example
    dotnet run --project captureImg
    ```
